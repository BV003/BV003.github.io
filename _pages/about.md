## Research


My current research focuses on energy-based models, with the aim of improving them for better performance. At the same time, I have a strong interest in post-training for large language models.

From a broader perspective, my research goals are twofold:

### To continuously make new discoveries in the field of artificial intelligence 
The rapid development of AI is remarkable, and I believe there are still many untapped treasures waiting to be explored.

### To create practical technologies that solve real-world problems 
I am committed to applying AI techniques to solve real-world problems and bring advanced algorithms into everyday applications.
