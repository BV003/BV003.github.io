## Research

My research is dedicated to developing more **capable, efficient, and aligned** Large Language Models (LLMs). I work across the entire LLM lifecycle, including training paradigms, data and inference efficiency, and the foundations of representations.

### Post-Training: Aligning and Enhancing LLMs
My recent work designs better post-training algorithms to improve reasoning, factuality, preference alignment, and model-based evaluation.

### Efficiency: Overcoming Data and Inference Bottlenecks
My research addresses critical bottlenecks in data efficiency and inference efficiency, from synthetic data generation to faster decoding.

### Foundations of Representation Learning
My work investigates the core principles of representation learning, uncovers limitations in language model representations, and proposes novel pre-training objectives to build more robust and capable foundation models.
