### Always Do Useful Things to Achieve Compounding
A good career is one where compounding exists. The work you do now will lead to better opportunities in the future. For me at this stage, internships (work) and research in trending areas of industry are useful things.  
One thing to watch out for is being hidden within the collective. The work you do may not receive clear external feedback. This has two sides: on the positive side, even if your work isn’t outstanding, you won’t be criticized; but on the negative side, you can’t improve yourself based on external feedback. You need to actively join the game.

### Build a Personal Brand

Google Scholar, GitHub, blog—I connect them all through my personal website.

### Learn New Technologies the Market Needs

Lifelong learning. Spend some time exploring new technologies, maybe create a simple demo and put it on GitHub, or write a blog post, or even record a video.
Finding peers to discuss with is also a good option.

### Switch Jobs to Find Better Opportunities

Changing jobs is a perfectly reasonable action. If companies can fire employees, why shouldn’t employees switch jobs?
Avoid having gaps between jobs. Don’t wait until you’re idle and have nothing to do before looking for new opportunities. Instead, start searching for them while you’re still employed, using your spare time.
At the same time, maintain good relationships with your former colleagues—that’s essential.
But don’t switch jobs too frequently.
